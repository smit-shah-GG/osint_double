## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- LangChain/LangGraph framework selected for agent orchestration
- News sources prioritized for initial crawlers
- Fully automated verification loop planned
- Knowledge graph included in beta scope
- Gemini model tiering strategy defined
- Use structlog for structured logging instead of loguru alone
- Make MCP integration optional to maintain flexibility
- Use async context manager pattern for clean resource management
- Use singleton pattern for MessageBus to ensure single hub instance
- Implement capability indexing for O(1) agent lookup
- Use Pydantic for message validation and type safety
- Use keyword matching for routing logic instead of LLM-based routing initially
- Implement fallback to SimpleAgent when primary workflow fails
- Build graph dynamically based on available agents in registry
- Use @server.list_tools() pattern for MCP 1.25.0 compatibility
- Use add_async_listener() for aiopubsub 3.0.0 API
- Create simplified integration tests for actual API validation
- Async-first architecture with sync wrappers for LangGraph integration
- Implement fallback decomposition strategy when Gemini unavailable
- Enforce hard refinement limits to prevent infinite loops
- Use 40% finding count + 60% confidence weighting for signal strength
- Use heap-based priority queue for efficient task ordering (O(log n))
- Multi-factor priority scoring: keyword 40%, recency 20%, retry penalty 20%, diversity 20%
- Four-component signal strength: keyword 30%, entity 20%, credibility 30%, density 20%
- Track four coverage dimensions: source diversity, geographic, temporal, topical
- Novelty-based diminishing returns: source 30%, entity 40%, content 30%
- Use RefinementEngine for iterative investigation improvements
- Limit hierarchy to 2 levels to prevent complexity explosion
- Track conflicts without attempting premature resolution
- Hard limit of 7 refinement iterations to prevent infinite loops
