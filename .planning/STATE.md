## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- LangChain/LangGraph framework selected for agent orchestration
- News sources prioritized for initial crawlers
- Fully automated verification loop planned
- Knowledge graph included in beta scope
- Gemini model tiering strategy defined
- Use structlog for structured logging instead of loguru alone
- Make MCP integration optional to maintain flexibility
- Use async context manager pattern for clean resource management
- Use singleton pattern for MessageBus to ensure single hub instance
- Implement capability indexing for O(1) agent lookup
- Use Pydantic for message validation and type safety
- Use keyword matching for routing logic instead of LLM-based routing initially
- Implement fallback to SimpleAgent when primary workflow fails
- Build graph dynamically based on available agents in registry
- Use @server.list_tools() pattern for MCP 1.25.0 compatibility
- Use add_async_listener() for aiopubsub 3.0.0 API
- Create simplified integration tests for actual API validation
- Async-first architecture with sync wrappers for LangGraph integration
- Implement fallback decomposition strategy when Gemini unavailable
- Enforce hard refinement limits to prevent infinite loops
- Use 40% finding count + 60% confidence weighting for signal strength
- Use heap-based priority queue for efficient task ordering (O(log n))
- Multi-factor priority scoring: keyword 40%, recency 20%, retry penalty 20%, diversity 20%
- Four-component signal strength: keyword 30%, entity 20%, credibility 30%, density 20%
- Track four coverage dimensions: source diversity, geographic, temporal, topical
- Novelty-based diminishing returns: source 30%, entity 40%, content 30%
- Use RefinementEngine for iterative investigation improvements
- Limit hierarchy to 2 levels to prevent complexity explosion
- Track conflicts without attempting premature resolution
- Hard limit of 7 refinement iterations to prevent infinite loops
- Three-layer deduplication: URL, content hash, semantic similarity
- 0.85 similarity threshold for semantic deduplication
- Exhaustive mode returns all relevant content regardless of age
- Complete metadata extraction including credibility and geographic context
- Investigation-scoped storage with investigation_id as primary key
- In-memory storage with optional JSON persistence for beta
- Message bus topics: investigation.start, crawler.fetch, crawler.complete, crawler.failed
- Automatic crawler triggering when Planning Agent detects news-related subtasks
- URL-based indexing for O(1) duplicate detection across investigations
- yarl for URL normalization (immutable URLs, RFC compliance)
- Domain-based authority: wire services 0.9, .gov/.edu 0.85, .org 0.7, social 0.3
- Investigation-scoped deduplication allows same URL in different investigations
- Entity-based context sharing with message bus broadcast on 'context.update' topic
- Reddit authority score: 0.3 for user-generated content
- Reddit quality thresholds: score > 10, comments > 5 for inclusion
- Follow comment threads for high-value posts (score > 100)
- Reddit message bus topics: reddit.crawl, reddit.complete, reddit.failed
